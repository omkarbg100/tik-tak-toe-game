# Tic Tac Toe

**A basic Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. No dependencies required.**


## How to Get Started
1. To make a move, the player will use a single mouse click to mark a space. In this version, there is no provision to undo a move. Once a move is made, the game proceeds to the next player's turn.
2. At each move, the game will indicate whose turn (Player A or Player B) it is. When the game ends, it displays one of the following outcomes:
   * Winner: Player A
   * Winner: Player B
   * Draw
